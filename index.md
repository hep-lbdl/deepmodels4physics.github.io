The aim of this meeting is to blah. This small-scale meeting will provide a forum to exchange problems, ideas, and techniques while leaving plenty of time for discussion and collaboration/hacking. Among the topics we would like to cover are blah and any applications of these techniques to problems in the physical sciences.

Registration is free but we ask you to **register before X, 2021** at [this link](registration.html).
