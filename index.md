## Rationale

High fidelity simulations are a foundational component of fundamental physics (particle physics, nuclear physics, astrophysics, cosmology) research.  However, these simulations are often too slow or are limited in key ways.  As a result, deep generative models have shown great promise for replacing or augmenting various aspects of data analysis in fundamental physics.  In the spirit of the likelihood-free inference workshop held about a year ago at the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS)](https://bids.berkeley.edu), we are gathering (virtually) at BIDS for an afternoon to exchange problems, ideas, and techniques in the area of deep generative modeling for fundamental physics (co-hosted with the [ML group in the Physics Division at Berkeley Lab](https://www.physics.lbl.gov/machinelearning/)).  Here is an incomplete list of topics we would like to cover:

- Applications of generative modeling to fundamental physics
- Physics-informed models
- Practicalities of training and inference (mode collapse, generation speed, staticial power, ...)
- Method comparisons (flows, autoencoders, GANs, ...)
- Implicit versus explicit density models (our focus is on generation and not density estimation, but interesting to know if the latter helps with the former)
- ...

Registration is free but we ask you to please register at [this link](registration.html).

## Code of Conduct

We are committed to making the meeting productive and enjoyable for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality or religion. We will not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Please follow these guidelines:

Behave professionally. Harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary comments or jokes are not appropriate. Harassment includes sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, sexual attention or innuendo, deliberate intimidation, stalking, and photography or recording of an individual without consent. It also includes offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race or religion. All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately. Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the event at the sole discretion of the organizers.

Any participant who wishes to report a violation of this policy is asked to speak, in confidence, to any of the meeting organizers.
